# Tiny Tapeout 10 - Enigma I Machine in Silicon!

Welcome to my contribution to Tiny Tapeout 10.  This is a complete, functional
implementation of the World War II era Enigma I cipher machine, implemented in a
160um x 100um footprint in SkyWater's 0.13um silicon CMOS process.

So, not only is it constructed mainly of sand, it's also only the size of a couple of grains of sand!

|This version is only 6.4million times smaller!|
