# Tiny Tapeout 10 - Enigma I Machine in Silicon!

Welcome to my contribution to Tiny Tapeout 10.  Once fabricated in March 2025,
this will be a complete, functional implementation of the World War II era
Enigma I cipher machine, implemented in a 160um x 100um footprint in SkyWater's
0.13um silicon CMOS process.

So, not only is it constructed mainly of sand, but it's also smaller than a single typical grain of sand!

||This version is only 6.4million times smaller!|
