# Tiny Tapeout 10 - An Enigma I Machine Made Out of Silicon

Welcome to my contribution to Tiny Tapeout 10.  Once fabricated in March 2025,
this TT10 project will be a complete and functional model of the World War II era
Enigma I cipher machine, occupying an area of 160um x 100um in SkyWater's
0.13um silicon CMOS process.

So, not only will this Enigma be built primarily out of sand, but it
will also end up being smaller than a single grain of beach sand!

||The silicon has a footprint that's 5.2 million times smaller than the original!
